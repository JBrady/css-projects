        I was supposed to take her to the Fireflies and walk away. You go
        halfway across the country with someone... She needed her immunity to
        mean somethin'. Maybe I was starting to buy into that whole cure
        business. Maybe I just wanted to do right by her. And then we made it.
        We found the Fireflies. And because of her, they were actually going to
        make a cure. The only catch... it would kill her.
